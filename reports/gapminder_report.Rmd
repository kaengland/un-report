This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a countryâ€™s economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP.

```{r read-data}

```{r gdp-lifeExp-1997-plot}
# make plot of GDP (X) vs. LifeExp (Y)
gapminder_1997%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "GDP per Capita", y = "Life Expectancy") +
